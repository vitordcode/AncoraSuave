# Soft anchor with javascript
```
$('html, body').animate({
    scrollTop: targetOffset - 100
}, 500);
```



##### The web is a tangle of links. A very common type of link is the anchor, which would be an internal link. Simply add href a pound sign (#) followed by a unique name eg href=”#contact” and assign an id=”contact” to the element on the page.

##### So when you click on the link, the scroll will automatically “jump” to where the element with the id is.

##### The purpose of this tutorial is to change this jump to a smooth scroll. This ensures the user understands the context in which they are, and where on the page this content is located.
